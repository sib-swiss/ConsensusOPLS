Title: Consensus OPLS For Multi-Block Data Fusion
Description: The fusion of data from multiple sources constitutes a relevant
    approach to assess complex systems comprehensively. However, inherent
    problems encountered when analysing single tables are amplified with the
    generation of multiblock datasets and finding the relationships between
    data layers of increasing complexity constitutes a challenging task. For
    that purpose, a generic methodology is proposed by combining the strengths
    of established data analysis strategies, i.e. multiblock approaches and
    the OPLS framework to offer an efficient tool for the fusion of data
    obtained from multiple sources. The package enables the consensus OPLS
    model to be implemented quickly and efficiently for any horizontal
    multiblock data structure (matching by observations). Moreover, it offers
    an exciting range of metrics and graphics to confidently aid in determining
    the optimal number of components and checking model validity through
    permutation testing. Interpretation tools include scores and loadings
    plots, as well as Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), and performance
    coefficients such as R2, Q2 and DQ2 coefficients.
