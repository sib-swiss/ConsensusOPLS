Title: Consensus OPLS for Multi-Block Data Fusion
Description: Merging data from multiple sources is a relevant approach for
    comprehensively evaluating complex systems. However, the inherent problems
    encountered when analyzing single tables are amplified with the generation
    of multi-block datasets, and finding the relationships between data layers
    of increasing complexity constitutes a challenging task. For that purpose,
    a generic methodology is proposed by combining the strengths of established
    data analysis strategies, i.e. multi-block approaches and the Orthogonal
    Partial Least Squares (OPLS) framework to provide an efficient tool for the
    fusion of data obtained from multiple sources. The package enables quick
    and efficient implementation of the consensus OPLS model for any horizontal
    multi-block data structure (observation-based matching). Moreover, it
    offers an interesting range of metrics and graphics to help to determine
    the optimal number of components and check the validity of the model
    through permutation tests. Interpretation tools include scores and loadings
    plots, as well as Variable Importance in Projection (VIP), and performance
    coefficients such as R2, Q2 and DQ2 coefficients. J. Boccard and D.N.
