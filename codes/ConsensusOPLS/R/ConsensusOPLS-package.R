#' @title Consensus OPLS For Multi-Block Data Fusion
#' @description
#' The fusion of data from multiple sources constitutes a relevant approach to
#' assess complex systems comprehensively. However, inherent problems
#' encountered when analysing single tables are amplified with the generation
#' of multiblock datasets and finding the relationships between data layers of
#' increasing complexity constitutes a challenging task. For that purpose, a
#' generic methodology is proposed by combining the strengths of established
#' data analysis strategies, i.e. multiblock approaches and the OPLS framework
#' to offer an efficient tool for the fusion of data obtained from multiple
#' sources. The package enables the consensus OPLS model to be implemented
#' quickly and efficiently for any horizontal multiblock data structure
#' (matching by observations). Moreover, it offers an exciting range of metrics
#' and graphics to confidently aid in determining the optimal number of
#' components and checking model validity through permutation testing.
#' Interpretation tools include scores and loadings plots, as well as Variable
#' Importance in Projection (VIP), and performance coefficients such as R2, Q2
#' and DQ2 coefficients.

#' College.
